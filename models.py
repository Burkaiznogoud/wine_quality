### Logistic Regression ### TESTED and WORKS but further investigation is needed.
logistic = lr.LogisticRegression_Algorithm()


### Decision Tree Classifier ### TESTED and WORKS. Not sure about results.

decision_tree = dt.DecisionTree_Algorithm()
### Support Vector Machine ### TESTED and WORKS but zero-division error pops up! Try to handle this warning and understand its source.
